# Clinic Appointment Booking System using PHP

[Clinic Appointment System](https://github.com/seanliew04/sean) is a web project made for managing appointments using PHP, HTML, and CSS. This system facilitates online appointment requests for clients or patients of medical establishments, including clinics and hospitals. It helps doctors manage their appointments with their patients by organizing each patient's appointment schedule. The system includes three key roles: administrator, doctor, and patient. Administrators can populate the list of doctors with their specialties and details. Patients can browse the system to find a doctor that meets their needs, review the doctor's weekly schedule, and submit appointment requests. Doctors can view all their appointments and patient requests based on their availability.
